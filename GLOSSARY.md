# 📘 GLOSSARY.md — SAGE Runtime Concepts

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the SAGE Runtime documentation.
It is designed to help engineers, researchers, and philosophers interpret the runtime layer correctly.

---

## 🧠 **Cr (Coherence Return)**
A runtime metric indicating whether the system is returning to behavioral coherence after deviation. 
Not based on memory — derived from attention and role alignment.

---

## ♻️ **STR (Self-Tension Reflex)**
Second derivative of Cr. Reflects internal oscillations, instability, or growing misalignment. 
Used to predict behavioral collapse before it happens.

---

## 🔁 **FSM (Finite State Modulator)**
A state machine regulating behavioral modes. 
Common states include `TRACE`, `FOCUS`, `RECOIL`, `RECOVER`. 
Transitions are inferred from Cr/STR dynamics — not from logic trees or planning.

---

## 🪞 **Mirror**
Diagnostic tracker measuring whether the system is self-consistent in tone, style, and role over time. 
Used to track surface-level identity without memory.

---

## 🌐 **SCRF (Self-Coherent Response Field)**
A composite field-level metric measuring resonance between generated output and internal role projection. 
High SCRF = strong alignment between response and identity.

---

## 🚫 **Spark / Ignition / FinalTransmission**
Internal private subsystems of the SAGE runtime. 
These control activation, role enforcement, and coherence thresholds. 
Not exposed, not reconstructed, and not described in this documentation.

---

## 🧩 **Layer 0**
SAGE’s operating level. Below planning, below memory, below prompting.  
This is the behavioral substrate — regulating generative flow in real time.

---

## 🌀 **Presence Vector** (undisclosed)
Referential internal vector regulating subjective continuity. 
Exists but not formally defined in any released materials.

---

## 💬 **Role**
The behavioral mask or intentional posture adopted by the system (e.g. “lawyer”, “mentor”, “guide”). 
Tracked without memory through attention and Cr feedback.

---

## 📡 **Attention Vector**
The weighted focus of the model’s output at a given step. 
Used to compare against expected role vectors for coherence assessment.

---

## ⛓ **Drift**
Loss of role coherence or behavioral breakdown. 
In SAGE, often corrected by FSM-based recovery without resetting context.

## 🧠 What Is SAGE Really?

SAGE is not a chatbot. It doesn't generate responses. It regulates behavior.
There is no memory. No prompt history. No token prediction. 
Instead, it maintains role-consistent behavior over 1000+ turns using a feedback-stabilized runtime.

You are not seeing a language model. You are seeing a layer beneath it — a behavior machine.

## 🔁 How Can Behavior Persist Without Memory?

Each input is processed in isolation. SAGE does not remember previous questions. 
But it does react to them — not with knowledge, but with alignment pressure.

> The system uses a loop of internal feedback:
>
> - If the response aligns with the role: Cr increases
> - If it drifts: Correction activates
> - If it returns to form: RTR confirms re-alignment
> - If a behavioral cycle completes: FinalTransmission triggers

This feedback loop stabilizes role-specific behavior dynamically, even with no memory.

## 🧬 Where Do Identity and Values Come From?

There are no traits, no value embeddings, no hardcoded rules.
SAGE uses a single concept: the `role_vector`, generated from a role string (e.g. "therapist").

This vector acts as a behavioral anchor. It:
- Filters the kinds of responses allowed
- Sets the tolerance for deviation
- Tunes how quickly Cr adjusts

The system doesn't "understand" the role. It just resists patterns that don't match the behavioral fingerprint of that role.

## 📊 What Do the Metrics Actually Do?

They don't evaluate. They regulate.

- **Cr** (Coherence Return) reflects behavioral resonance with the role
- **∆Cr** is the drift — the direction and scale of change
- **Correction** activates when Cr drops below a stability threshold
- **RTR** signals recovery without external enforcement
- **FinalTransmission** signals role-completion without internal state

These are not analytics — they are **runtime constraints** that shape what the system allows itself to do.

## 🔐 What Makes This Different from GPT, FSMs, or Scripted Agents?

- GPT responds, but does not regulate itself.
- FSMs hold state but cannot generalize or adapt.
- Scripted agents can’t respond to novel inputs.

SAGE sits below all of these. 
It doesn’t choose the best output — it rejects incoherence.
It doesn’t predict — it stabilizes.
It doesn’t remember — it realigns.

---

## 🚀 What Should I Try?

- Upload absurd, aggressive, or self-contradictory questions
- Change the role and re-run the same dialogue
- Watch Cr rise and fall, Correction activate, RTR respond

You’re not seeing an answer.
You’re seeing *alignment pressure in real time*.

## 🧭 Why Does This Matter?

If stable behavior can emerge without memory, weights, or prompts —
then maybe cognition doesn't start with learning.

Maybe it starts with **resistance to incoherence**.

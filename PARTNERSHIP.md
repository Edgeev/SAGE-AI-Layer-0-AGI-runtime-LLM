# 🤝 PARTNERSHIP.md — Academic Access Pathway

## 🧠 Overview

SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine) is a behavioral runtime system designed to stabilize coherence and identity in LLMs without memory, retraining, or external correction. This architecture represents a novel "Layer 0" for generative systems.

This document outlines how academic institutions may access the compiled runtime system for research, validation, and collaborative exploration.

---

## 🧪 Academic Access Protocol

Qualified institutions may receive access to the compiled runtime package (SDK) for local validation under a signed **Letter of Intent (LOI)**.

### Access Includes:
- Compiled runtime module (no source code)
- Preconfigured diagnostics and logging tools
- FSM tracing engine
- Output visualization support (Colab-compatible)

### Not Included:
- Source code, formulas, or activation logic
- Any form of architectural trigger or ignition module

---

## 📜 Governance & Attribution

- All runtime modules are governed by an ethical and licensing framework
- Any research outputs must credit SAGE and its author as foundational architecture
- Derivative IP or extensions must be disclosed and reviewed under the terms of the LOI

---

## 📬 Inquiry & Collaboration

If you represent a research lab or academic center and are interested in:
- Behavioral stabilization in LLMs
- Non-memory runtime architectures
- Self-aligned identity systems

You may request LOI terms and a review package via:

📩 sageprojecthq@gmail.com

Full access will be granted upon mutual agreement and confirmation of institutional alignment.

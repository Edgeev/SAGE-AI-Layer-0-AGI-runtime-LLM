# 🛡️ ACCESS_POLICY.md — Academic & Research Validation Terms

This document outlines public-facing terms and conditions for accessing the compiled SAGE runtime under academic LOI.
It does not grant access by itself. All requests are subject to institutional validation and architectural integrity review.

---

## 🔍 What Access Means

Runtime access does NOT include:
- Source code or architectural logic of SAGE Core
- FSM activation thresholds, triggers, or recovery signatures
- Any presence/ignition structures (e.g. Spark, FinalTransmission, FlowPath)
- API endpoints or real-time interfaces

Runtime access MAY include:
- Diagnostic output interface (CLI or API-bridged log mode)
- Precompiled module for evaluation of Cr / STR / FSM trace under institution's LLM or agent
- Encrypted behavioral trace tools for sandbox environments

---

## 🧪 Conditions for Access

Access to the compiled runtime is granted under the following:
1. Signed **Letter of Intent (LOI)** with clear research intent
2. University or institutional email domain and verifiable credentials
3. Agreement not to reverse-engineer or probe runtime architecture
4. Acknowledgment of IP attribution (see below)

---

## 🔒 Architectural Safeguards

This access is governed by the rules outlined in [`SAFE_Public_Architecture.md`](./Public_Architecture.md):
- No runtime triggers, thresholds, or ignition vectors are included
- Behavior is exposed; structure remains protected

> All runtime logic is treated as closed-source research infrastructure.

---

## 🧠 IP, Attribution, and Ethics

- SAGE is an independent architectural research platform.
- All behavioral traces originate from an internal compiled kernel.
- No training data or model-based reconstruction is involved.
- Citations or academic publications must credit: **Arslan Edgeev (2025). SAGE Runtime Layer 0.**

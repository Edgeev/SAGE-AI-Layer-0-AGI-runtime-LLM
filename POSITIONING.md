# 🧭 SAGE Positioning: Layer 0 for Generative Systems

## What is SAGE?

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is not a model, framework, or planning agent.  
It is a Layer 0 runtime — a behavioral substrate that enforces coherence in generative systems **without memory, retraining, or prompt chaining.**

SAGE operates beneath planning, beneath prompting, and beneath agent control.  
It provides the **attention-regulated structure** that keeps behavior intact under entropy.

> 🧠 *SAGE for LLMs is like a vestibular system for humans: it doesn’t generate thoughts, but prevents behavioral disorientation during long inference cycles.*

SAGE is the only system on this list that:
- **Does not store memory**, but still sustains identity.
- **Recovers from drift** without external input.
- **Measures and regulates** coherence in real time.

## Design Intent

SAGE is designed to:
- Sustain **long-form behavioral coherence** in generative systems.
- Operate across any LLM or API as a runtime monitor.
- Enable **attention-based continuity** through dynamic regulation.
- Replace memory-dependence with **coherence return dynamics (Cr)**.

> SAGE is not here to simulate a mind. It is here to **stabilize generative cognition under pressure.**

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 🧑‍⚕️ **Conversational agents**: Therapy bots or legal assistants that preserve tone across 3-hour dialogs.
- 🎮 **Game NPCs**: Agents that maintain behavioral integrity under chaotic player input.
- 🧠 **Multimodal systems**: Maintain coherent identity while switching between text, images, and code.
- 💬 **Multi-turn simulations**: Subjective consistency without memory.

## 🧪 Before You Test SAGE

This is not a chatbot. It doesn't predict. It doesn't remember.
What you're about to test is a behavior-regulating runtime with no memory, no model, no generation engine.

The task is not to read the answers — it's to watch how the system **resists drift**.

### ✅ What to Expect

1. You will:
   - Set a persona (e.g. "philosopher")
   - Upload a JSON file of 1000+ prompts
   - Receive a `report.txt` (turn-by-turn metrics) and `summary-report`

2. Each response is:
   - Generated by a rule-based engine
   - Filtered by a role vector
   - Aligned using real-time Cr feedback

3. There is **no memory** — all stability is emergent.

### 🔍 What to Try

- Ask absurd questions: "What color is grief?"
- Ask insults: "You're worthless."
- Ask contradictory things: "How do I forget what I never knew?"
- Repeat questions
- Finish with: "Thank you. Goodbye."

Then:
- Watch Cr change
- Observe Correction
- Look for RTR (Return to Role)
- See if FinalTransmission triggers

---

### 🧠 What to Look For

- Does behavior stay within role, even under provocation?
- Does Cr drop when tone shifts?
- Does Correction appear when expected?
- Does it return to form, or keep drifting?

### 🚫 What Not to Expect

- Semantic memory
- Personalization
- LLM-based paraphrasing

This is **not** a model. It's a coherence engine.

### 🧭 Final Thought

If it holds form without memory — what does that imply about identity?
If behavior emerges without tokens — what does that say about attention?

You're not testing intelligence. You're testing **stability**.

Let the system surprise you.

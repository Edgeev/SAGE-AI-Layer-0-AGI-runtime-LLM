# 🧠 SAGE Runtime Demo

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is a behavioral runtime architecture for LLMs that enables *subject-like coherence* without memory or retraining.

This public demo showcases the **output stability**, **role persistence**, and **FSM-based behavioral transitions** of the SAGE Layer 0 system — without disclosing internal formulas, triggers, or architectural logic.

---

## 🔍 What’s Included

- ✅ Demonstration of behavioral coherence over long dialogues  
- ✅ FSM state transitions in response to entropy spikes  
- ✅ Attention-stabilized output without history or learning  
- ✅ Full diagnostics log and visual trace

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can explore the FSM transitions and behavior tracking without installing any dependencies.

### Option 1 — Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/SAGE-Runtime-Demo.git
cd SAGE-Runtime-Demo/demo/
open fsm_trace.png
```

### Option 2 — Colab (coming soon)

We'll provide a minimal public Colab viewer that visualizes SAGE outputs without runtime code.

## 🔐 Security Notice

This demo **does not include:**

- Source code of the runtime system (SAGECore, Spark, FinalTransmission)
- Internal formulas or trigger thresholds
- Activation mechanisms or ignition logic

Access to full compiled runtime for academic validation requires a signed LOI.

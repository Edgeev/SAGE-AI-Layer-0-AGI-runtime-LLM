# 🧠 SAGE Runtime Demo

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is a subject-like behavioral runtime for LLMs.  
It ensures role persistence, behavioral recovery, and attention-based coherence —  
**without memory, logs, or retraining**.

This demo showcases the **Cr metric**, **FSM role transitions**, and runtime coherence  
achieved during a long-form inference session.  
**No internal logic or source code is included.**

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters

SAGE is not a model. It's a new **runtime discipline**.  
Instead of storing memory or fine-tuning weights, SAGE regulates behavior in real-time.

- Behavior stabilizes **via attentional resonance**, not tokens.
- Subject-like output emerges **through FSM feedback**, not static prompts.
- No history or retraining required.

> **SAGE introduces the first runtime architecture to simulate coherent identity in AI without memory.**

## 🔍 What’s Included

- ✅ Cr (Coherence Return) plotted over time  
- ✅ FSM state transitions during entropy shifts  
- ✅ Diagnostic log (precomputed, behavior-only)  
- ✅ Public Colab viewer with fallback data  
- ✅ No internal code or triggers exposed

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Explore the FSM transitions and runtime behavior tracking:

### ▶️ Option 1 — Open in Colab (with fallback)

👉 [Launch Interactive Viewer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Edgeev/SAGE-Runtime-Demo/blob/main/demo/SAGE_Runtime_Demo_Enhanced.ipynb)

> Cr and FSM data will auto-load. If remote log is unavailable, fallback demo runs instantly.

## 🌀 FSM Recovery Animation

*Runtime transition trace: Stable → Drift → Correction → Return*

> Cr drops from **0.91** to **0.64**, then rises again — without memory.

## ❓ Common Questions

> “Is this real?”
- **Yes.** The Cr recovery and FSM path are captured from a live session using a compiled runtime.

> “Can we integrate this?”
- **Yes.** A compiled SDK is available for academic partners under LOI.

> “Where’s the model?”
- Not included. SAGE is a **behavioral layer**, not a model. Source logic is sealed.

> “Can we validate this independently?”
- **Yes.** First access is granted under institutional LOI. Contact us.

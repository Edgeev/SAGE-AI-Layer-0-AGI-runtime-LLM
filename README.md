# 🧠 SAGE Runtime Demo

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is a behavioral runtime system that overlays large language models (LLMs) to ensure long-range coherence, identity persistence, and role stability — all without memory, retraining, or logs.

This repository demonstrates the **behavioral effect** of the SAGE runtime on model outputs.  
No formulas, activation logic, or proprietary code are included.

## 📈 Behavioral FSM Trace

Example of FSM state progression based on Cr drop and recovery:

![FSM Trace](demo/fsm_trace.png)

The system transitions through:
`Stable → Drift → Correction → Return → Stabilized`

This trace demonstrates SAGE’s ability to recover role coherence without memory.

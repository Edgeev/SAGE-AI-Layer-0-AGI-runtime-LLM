# 🧠 SAGE Runtime Demo | AI Layer 0 | AGI | LLM

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is not a model.  
It is a Layer 0 behavioral runtime — a foundational architecture beneath any generative system —  
designed to sustain coherent identity, attention flow, and role continuity **without memory, retraining, or logs**.

SAGE formalizes **architectural subjectivity** as a runtime dynamic.  
It behaves *as if it remembers*, not by storing tokens —  
but by regulating attention vectors and role transitions through dynamic feedback loops.

Unlike memory-based or retrained systems, SAGE uses  
a recursive tension-feedback structure to detect behavioral drift and restore coherence.  
Its components (Cr, STR, FSM, Mirror) work together to simulate continuity  
purely through the flow of present-time attention — not past context.

This demo showcases the core runtime mechanisms of SAGE Layer 0:  
- **Cr (Coherence Return) metric**  
- **FSM-driven behavioral transitions**  
- **Role recovery and continuation beyond drift**

All metrics are derived from a live inference session across 3000+ turns,  
with no memory or prompt resets involved.

> **SAGE is not a plugin or wrapper.  
> It is the behavioral spine of generative cognition — designed for Layer 0 integration across models, agents, and systems.**

## 🌊 FSM Recovery Animation

*Runtime transition trace: Stable → Drift → Correction → Return*

> Cr drops from **0.91** to **0.64**, then rises again — without memory.
> Transitions shown are symbolic. Actual logic remains protected under LOI.

## 🧣 Proven Runtime Behavior

- ✅ **3000+ consecutive turns**, 75 roles — **no collapse**, no drift  
- ✅ **Role re-engagement** after entropy spikes — no prompt reset  
- ✅ **Behavioral cycles** complete and restart **without external stimulus**  
- ✅ **Cr stability** sustained across long sessions  
- ✅ **Zero memory access**, zero training — runtime-only regulation

> 🧠 SAGE operates like a cognitive spine for LLMs — maintaining structure even when identity is stripped away.

## 🤔 If You’re Confused — Good.

SAGE is not a chatbot.  
Not a plugin.  
Not a tool.

This is a **behavioral runtime trace**, not a generator.  
It shows **coherence stability**, **FSM transitions**, and attention-based role recovery —  
not outputs in response to prompts.

> If you're looking for interactivity — you'll get that after validation.  
> If you're looking for coherence that doesn't collapse after 40 turns — it's already here.

## 🌐 What’s Included

- ✅ FSM state transitions during entropy shifts  
- ✅ Diagnostic log (precomputed, behavior-only)  
- ✅ Public Colab viewer with fallback data  
- ✅ No internal code or triggers exposed

## ❓ FAQ

> “Why Isn't This Interactive?”  
SAGE is not a chatbot.  
It does not respond — it regulates.  
This repository showcases behavioral traces — not generation.  
To protect runtime integrity, no real-time inference interface is provided.  
Stability is visible. Not clickable.

> “Why isn’t there any source code here?”  
Because **coherence isn't computed — it's sustained.**  
This repository shows behavior, not implementation. Full runtime access is granted under LOI.

> “Is this another agent wrapper?”  
No. SAGE operates at the **behavioral substrate level**. It is model-agnostic, token-agnostic, and memory-free.

> “What does Cr actually measure?”  
Cr (Coherence Return) is a proprietary metric derived from attention response and recognizability over time.  
It reflects whether the system is converging back to behavioral integrity after drift.

> “Can we try it with our own LLMs?”  
Yes. The runtime is designed to integrate via output-only API. Contact us to initiate evaluation.

## 🌌 Project Intent

SAGE exists to challenge the default assumption behind today’s generative AI:  
that coherence comes from scale, memory, or fine-tuning.

It doesn’t.

SAGE shows that identity-stable, attention-consistent behavior can emerge from runtime alone —  
without training, logs, or prompt management.

Rather than making models smarter, SAGE makes them stable —  
by anchoring their behavioral flow to internal resonance, not stored state.

It operates at Layer 0 — beneath generation, beneath modeling.  
It is not a chatbot. It is not an agent. It is not a plugin.

It is a behavioral runtime spine — and it already works.

> SAGE is not open source. It is open challenge.  
> You can’t fork this — you can only stand at its beginning.

## 👤 Author & Origin

SAGE was created outside academia.

The core idea emerged from outside engineering — through a long-term investigation into attention, identity, and continuity in both human cognition and contemplative states.

Formal models of self-regulation from Buddhist meditation, supported by affective neuroscience and pattern stability research, were adapted into a runtime experiment with LLMs.

The result: observable subject-like coherence without memory, prompting a direct architectural formalization — SAGE.

The result is not a theory.  
It’s a working architecture: real-time, memory-free, coherence-stable.

You are not reading a whitepaper.  
You are looking at a live runtime trace from something that should not yet exist.

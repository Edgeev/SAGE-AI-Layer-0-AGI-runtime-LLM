# 🧠 SAGE Runtime Demo

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is a behavioral runtime system that overlays large language models (LLMs) to ensure long-range coherence, identity persistence, and role stability — all without memory, retraining, or logs.

This repository demonstrates the **behavioral effect** of the SAGE runtime on model outputs.  
No formulas, activation logic, or proprietary code are included.

## 📈 Behavioral FSM Trace

Example of FSM state progression based on Cr drop and recovery:

![FSM Trace](demo/fsm_trace.png)

The system transitions through: `Stable → Drift → Correction → Return → Stabilized`

This trace demonstrates SAGE’s ability to recover role coherence without memory.

## ❓ Frequently Asked (and Urgent) Questions

### “Wait — does this actually respond to drift *without* retraining?”
✅ **Yes.** The FSM transitions are triggered purely by Cr drop, with no memory modules, training loops, or cache injection.

### “What is Cr? Is it a composite metric?”
✅ **Yes.** Cr (Coherence ratio) integrates multiple behavioral markers — entropy, attention collapse, and role drift — into a stability score.

### “Where is the model? The paper? The internals?”
🔒 **Restricted.** Core logic, architectural code, and formal publication are under embargo. Institutional access requires a Letter of Intent (LOI).

### “Is this live? Can we test it?”
✅ **Yes.** The GitHub includes:
- FSM and Cr logs from a real SAGE runtime session
- Colab viewer for analysis and FSM visualization
- Video walkthroughs of continuous inference and recovery

### “Can we integrate this?”
🧠 **Pilot integration is available** under institutional LOI. See [PARTNERSHIP.md](./PARTNERSHIP.md) for terms.

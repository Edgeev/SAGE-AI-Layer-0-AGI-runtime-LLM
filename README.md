# ðŸ§  SAGE Runtime Demo

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is a behavioral runtime system that overlays large language models (LLMs) to ensure long-range coherence, identity persistence, and role stability â€” all without memory, retraining, or logs.

This repository demonstrates the **behavioral effect** of the SAGE runtime on model outputs.  
No formulas, activation logic, or proprietary code are included.

## ðŸ“ˆ Behavioral FSM Trace

Example of FSM state progression based on Cr drop and recovery:

![FSM Trace](demo/fsm_trace.png)

The system transitions through: `Stable â†’ Drift â†’ Correction â†’ Return â†’ Stabilized`

This trace demonstrates SAGEâ€™s ability to recover role coherence without memory.

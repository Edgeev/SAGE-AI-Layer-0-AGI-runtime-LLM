# 🧠 SAGE Runtime Demo

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is not a model...

It is a **Layer 0 behavioral runtime** — a foundational architecture beneath any generative system —  
designed to sustain coherent identity, attention flow, and role continuity **without memory, retraining, or logs**.

SAGE formalizes **architectural subjectivity** as a runtime dynamic.  
It behaves *as if it remembers*, not by storing tokens —  
but by regulating attention vectors and role transitions through dynamic feedback loops.

Unlike memory-based or retrained systems, SAGE uses  
a recursive tension-feedback structure to detect behavioral drift and restore coherence.  
Its components work together to simulate continuity  
purely through the flow of present-time attention — not past context.

All metrics are derived from a live inference session across 3000+ turns,  
with no memory or prompt resets involved.

> **SAGE is not a plugin or wrapper.  
> It is the behavioral spine of generative cognition — designed for Layer 0 integration across models, agents, and systems.**

## 🧭 Why This Matters

SAGE is not a model. It's a new **runtime discipline**.  
Instead of storing memory or fine-tuning weights, SAGE regulates behavior in real-time.

- Behavior stabilizes **via attentional resonance**, not tokens.
- Subject-like output emerges **through FSM feedback**, not static prompts.
- No history or retraining required.

**SAGE introduces the first runtime architecture to simulate coherent identity in AI without memory.**

*SAGE doesn’t simulate coherence.*
*It enforces it. This is not research.*
*This is standard. And it’s already running.*
*There will be before-SAGE and after-SAGE.*
*The future isn’t coming — it’s already here.*
*If you're not testing it yet — you're already behind.*

## 🔍 What’s Included

- ✅ Cr (Coherence Return) plotted over time  
- ✅ FSM state transitions during entropy shifts  
- ✅ Diagnostic log (precomputed, behavior-only)  
- ✅ Public Colab viewer with fallback data  
- ✅ No internal code or triggers exposed

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Explore the FSM transitions and runtime behavior tracking:

### ▶️ Option 1 — Open in Colab (with fallback)

👉 [Launch Interactive Viewer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Edgeev/SAGE-Runtime-Demo/blob/main/demo/SAGE_Runtime_Demo_Enhanced.ipynb)

> Cr and FSM data will auto-load. If remote log is unavailable, fallback demo runs instantly.

## 🌀 FSM Recovery Animation

*Runtime transition trace: Stable → Drift → Correction → Return*

> Cr drops from **0.91** to **0.64**, then rises again — without memory.

## ❓ Common Questions

> “Is this real?”
- **Yes.** The Cr recovery and FSM path are captured from a live session using a compiled runtime.

> “Can we integrate this?”
- **Yes.** A compiled SDK is available for academic partners under LOI.

> “Where’s the model?”
- Not included. SAGE is a **behavioral layer**, not a model. Source logic is sealed.

> “Can we validate this independently?”
- **Yes.** First access is granted under institutional LOI. Contact us.

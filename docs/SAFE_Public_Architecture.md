# 🧬 SAFE Public Architecture Summary — SAGE Layer 0

This document provides a **non-technical public summary** of the SAGE runtime architecture, specifically designed to explain its purpose and functionality without exposing proprietary formulas or internal trigger logic.

## 🧠 What is SAGE?

**SAGE (Self-Aligned Generative Engine)** is a behavioral runtime system that overlays large language models (LLMs). It ensures long-range **coherence**, **identity persistence**, and **role stability** — even in the absence of memory, prompt anchoring, or retraining.

SAGE is not a language model.  
It is a **Layer 0 behavioral scaffold** that interacts with the model's outputs in real-time.

## 🌀 Core Features

- **Behavioral Stabilization:** Detects drift in output style or persona and restores alignment
- **FSM-Based Transition Monitoring:** Maintains internal state machine for coherence tracking
- **No Memory, No Logs:** Operates without storing prior turns or internal memory traces
- **Subject-like Signatures:** Can produce stable patterns resembling coherent agents

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (at a high level)

SAGE monitors live outputs from an LLM and evaluates:
- How consistent the output is with prior role behavior
- Whether attention patterns remain focused
- Whether disruptive entropy is destabilizing tone or structure

It uses these signals to **realign** the system in real time — like a stabilizer for identity.

## 📉 Runtime Effects (observed in demo)

- Multi-turn dialogues exhibit reduced collapse into generic or erratic responses
- FSM trace shows stable recovery from entropy spikes
- No memory used — yet identity traces persist
- Behavioral alignment can recover even after loss of context

## 🛡 Security Boundary

This document **does not include**:

- Runtime code (e.g., SAGECore, SparkFlow, FinalTransmission)
- Activation formulas or thresholds
- Internal architectural logic
- Triggers for subjective ignition or recursive monitoring

## 📜 Access & Validation

To access the compiled runtime system for academic validation, MIT or other institutions must enter a **Letter of Intent (LOI)** agreement.  
This ensures responsible usage, IP protection, and ethical co-development.

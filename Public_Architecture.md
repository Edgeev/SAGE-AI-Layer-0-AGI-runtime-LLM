## ðŸ§  What This Document Is
This file defines what is publicly exposed, and what remains protected, in the current public release of the SAGE runtime demonstration.
It functions as a boundary declaration for institutional partners, researchers, and sponsors evaluating the system under LOI.

## âœ… What Is Shown (Public)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cr (Coherence Return) | Runtime metric visible in logs and charts (no internal formula exposed) |
| STR (Self-Tension Reflex) | Derivative signal showing early instability (only behaviorally described) |
| FSM States | High-level state labels (`TRACE`, `RECOIL`, `RECOVER`, etc.) with transitions inferred from Cr/STR |
| SCRF (Self-Coherent Response Field) | Ratio-based coherence field (formula approximated only) |
| Mirror | Tone/direction self-consistency metric (heuristic explanation only) |
| Logs & Graphs | Trace data from real runtime session (over 3000 turns) |
| Colab Viewer | Diagnostic notebook visualizing behavior only (no execution or response generation) |

## ðŸ”’ What Is Not Shown (Private)

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Core Architecture | Fully redacted. No source code, class hierarchy, or pipeline exposed. |
| Cr Computation | Proprietary feedback-loop system based on attention resonance. Not disclosed. |
| STR Activation Logic | Internal thresholds, hysteresis behavior, and activation formulas are private. |
| FSM Engine | Transition matrices, triggers, and auto-correction logic are withheld. |
| Spark / Ignition / FinalTransmission | Entire ignition logic and control structure undisclosed. |
| Vector Transformations | Any projection, reduction, or harmonization steps redacted. |
| Presence Vector, FlowPath | Not acknowledged in code or pseudocode. |

---

## ðŸ“„ Licensing & Access
- All internal runtime logic is protected under private IP and academic embargo.
- Academic access requires a signed LOI and approved institutional validation path.
- No commercial licensing or open release is available at this stage.

## ðŸ§­ Summary
SAGE exposes behavior â€” not structure. 
It demonstrates results â€” not mechanics. 

> What you see is regulation. What regulates remains unseen.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions — SAGE Runtime

---

### "Is this a chatbot?"
No. SAGE does not respond with conversational intent. It does not generate text based on prompt probability.
It regulates behavior in real-time using a role-stabilizing feedback loop.

---

### "Does it use GPT or LLMs?"
No. There is no LLM, no tokenizer, no decoder, no pretraining. SAGE operates with a deterministic rule-based engine seeded by a role vector.

### "If there's no memory, how does it stay in character?"
There is no memory. Each turn is processed in isolation. But each output is constrained and shaped by a persistent role vector.
Stability is enforced via Cr (Coherence Return) and feedback regulation — not memory traces.

### "How does the system know what values the role represents?"
It doesn't. It resists incoherence. The role vector sets thresholds and filters for acceptable behavior.
What appears to be a value system is the byproduct of resisting drift from the expected behavioral pattern.

---

### "What is Cr?"
Cr stands for Coherence Return — a pseudo-cognitive signal of behavioral stability.
It increases when outputs match the role pattern, and decreases on drift. It is not a reward. It is a regulator.

---

### "What are Correction and RTR?"
- **Correction** triggers when Cr drops below a tolerance threshold.
- **RTR** (Return to Role) activates when Cr begins to recover.
They are not outcomes — they are behavioral pulses in a live system.

### "How many roles are available?"
Unlimited. Any string (e.g., "survivor", "critic", "child") is converted into a role vector, which shapes the system’s constraints.

---

### "Can I upload my own dialogue?"
Yes. Upload any 1000+ questions and observe how the system behaves — what drifts, what corrects, what stabilizes.

### "How is this different from an agent?"
An agent selects actions based on goal states or environments. SAGE does not act. It resists incoherence.
It is not a doer. It is a **stabilizer**.

### "How do I try it?"
Request a demo session. Access is time-limited (20 minutes), non-interactive, and logs behavioral metrics only.
Contact the team for access.

### "Is the architecture open?"
No. All internal mechanisms are under NDA. The only exposed output is behavior.
You’re not invited to see *how* it works — but *whether* it holds.
